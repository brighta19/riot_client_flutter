# riot_client_flutter

A new Flutter project that mimics the Riot's sign in client design. My intention was to see how creating UI with Flutter worked.

This is meant to be built for windows, but its Flutter, so other platforms should work. There is no functionality at all. The images are just screenshots from the real client, apart from the large backgroun image (which I got from somewhere ...). I have no idea what the font for the client is.
